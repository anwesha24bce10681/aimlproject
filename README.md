# Autonomous Delivery Agent

## Project Overview
This project implements an autonomous delivery agent that navigates a 2D grid city to deliver packages.  
It models static obstacles, varying terrain costs, and dynamic moving obstacles.

## Features
- Environment modeling (static + dynamic obstacles)
- BFS, Uniform Cost Search (UCS), A* search, and Hill-Climbing with random restarts
- Proof-of-concept dynamic replanning with moving obstacles

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Running the Project
```bash
python main.py
